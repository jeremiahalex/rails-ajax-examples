 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.

 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

// Since materialize color scheme are declared in color.scss you should import the color.scss first. then you can override color variable just like this:
@import "materialize/components/color";
$primary-color: color("green", "lighten-2") !default;
$secondary-color: color("orange", "darken-2") !default;
// Then Import Materialize styles
@import "materialize";
